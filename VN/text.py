    'It\'s been about 2 years since I graduated college.',
    'Luckily for me, I got a job offer almost as soon as I graduated so I didn\'t have\
 to go though all the trouble of finding work. If I had to complain about something \
it would definately have to be my perpetual boredom.',
'I\'ve got no hobbies, no real interests, and nothing to do but work everyday. I wanted a change of pace so I bought myself a \
pet turtle (his name is Jimmy). Him and my roommate have done a lot to help me but even so I just can\'t seem to shake this feeling.',
    'User*Sigh* Mornin\' Jimmy. I guess it\'s gonna be another uneventful day huh, bud?',
    'Jimmy.....*blub*',
    'UserYeah, that\'s what I thought. Welp, let\'s get this show on the road!',
    '...........',
    'My office is located in the heart of Toronto. I don\'t make enough money to live close to the office so my friend, Aiya, and \
I rented a place out together, mainly because she also works nearby. Since I go to work earlier than she does, I\'m usually the one making \
breakfast. Thanks to that I\'ve gotten pretty good if I do say so myself.',
'I was a bit more tired than usual this morning and I got lazy so for today\'s breakfast, scrambled eggs over toast should do it.',
'UserMmm- pretty good. Sometimes a simple breakfast really is the best.',
'Having finished breakfast, I tidied up, left some food out for Aiya, and got ready for work.',
'The area I lived in wasn\'t anything special. It\'s a nice distance away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Toronto. \
Frankly, I\'m pretty glad I live somewhere like this. Being in the city can be quite the exhausting experience.',
'The air here is soothing and the scenery makes me feel relaxed. The bus stop is only a ten minute walk from where I live \
so I try and make the most of the walk.',
f'WomanHeya {name}! Good morning!',
'The woman calling out to me in such an energetic fashion is Rebecca. She goes to the university here and we happen to ride the same bus. \
You wouldn\'t expect her to have a good head on her shoulders just by looking at her. She\'s unexpentedly smart and plenty cute as well.',
'We first met a little after I started working. I had always been the only person at this stop so the sudden appearance \
was a shock, but a welcome one.',
'UserYea, mornin\' Becca.',
'RebeccaNo bagel today?',
'To explain, the first time we met she apparently had skipped breakfast as I could hear her stomach relentlessly growling. \
I was a little late that day so I brought a bagel with me to eat on the commute. I felt kinda bad so I offered her half of my bagel \
and it\'s been our thing ever since. Today however, I was out of bagels.',
'UserSorry we just ran out. I\'ll make sure to get some on my way home today.',
'RebeccaYou better. I don\'t know how I\'ll survive without them. The ones you bring always taste better for some reason.',
'UserI get them at a bakery not many people know about. Maybe I\'ll take you there someday. They\'re a lot better when they\'re fresh.',
'Of course that probably wasn\'t going to happen. It\'s not like we talk to each other beyond this morning commute.',
'RebeccaYeah. I\'d like that.',
'The rest of the ride was the same as any other day. We talked about what we did the other day, our favourite TV shows, good restaurants \
in the area, anything really. Everything was the same but something felt a little different, though I couldn\'t tell what it was.',
'User(Maybe it\'s the lack of bagel)',
'The time flew by as we talked and soon enough we arrived at Rebecca\'s stop.',
'RebeccaWell, I\'m off. I\'m holding you to that offer m\'kay? Later, see\'ya tomorrow!',
'UserMhm, see\'ya tomorrow.',
'The rest of my ride was filled with the cacophony of the city and soon enough I arrived at work.',
'......................',
'First thing I do is make my daily round to the Keurig machine. Can\'t start the day otherwise.',
