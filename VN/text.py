    'Luckily for me, I got a job offer almost as soon as I graduated so I didn\'t have\
 to go though all the trouble of finding work. If I had to complain about something \
it would definately have to be my perpetual boredom.',
'I\'ve got no hobbies, no real interests, and nothing to do but work everyday. I wanted a change of pace so I bought myself a \
pet turtle (his name is Jimmy). Him and my roommate have done a lot to help me but even so I just can\'t seem to shake this feeling.',
    'User: *Sigh* Mornin\' Jimmy. I guess it\'s gonna be another uneventful day huh, bud?',
    'Jimmy: .....*blub*',
    'User: Yeah, that\'s what I thought. Welp, let\'s get this show on the road!',
    '...........',
    'My office is located in the heart of Toronto. I don\'t make enough money to live close to the office so my friend, Aiya, and \
I rented a place closer to the outskirts together, mainly because she also works nearby. Since I go to work earlier than she does, I\'m usually the one making \
breakfast. Thanks to that I\'ve gotten pretty good if I do say so myself.',
'I was a bit more tired than usual this morning and I got lazy so for today\'s breakfast, scrambled eggs over toast should do it.',
'User: Mmm- pretty good. Sometimes a simple breakfast really is the best.',
'Having finished breakfast, I tidied up, left some food out for Aiya, and got ready for work.',
'The area I lived in wasn\'t anything special. It\'s a nice distance away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Toronto. \
Frankly, I\'m pretty glad I live somewhere like this. Being in the city can be quite the exhausting experience.',
'The air here is soothing and the scenery makes me feel relaxed. The bus stop is only a ten minute walk from where I live \
so I try and make the most of the walk.',
f'Woman: Heya {name}! Good morning!',
'The woman calling out to me in such an energetic fashion is Rebecca. She goes to the university here and we happen to ride the same bus. \
You wouldn\'t expect her to have a good head on her shoulders just by looking at her. She\'s unexpentedly smart and plenty cute as well.',
'Her short, blonde hair went well with her playful personality. She wasn\'t very tall, maybe about 5\'4\"? \
Her smaller frame and petite facial features are decieving to say the least. Only her large, round eyes juxtaposed the rest of her appearance. Honestly, you \
could probably mistake her for a middle schooler if not for her massive bo-*cough*. Okay, maybe I\'m stretching it but she \
really does look younger than she is.',
'User: Yea, mornin\' Becca.',
'We first met a little after I started working. I had always been the only person at this stop so the sudden appearance \
was a shock, but a welcome one.',
'Rebecca: No bagel today?',
'To explain, the first time we met she apparently had skipped breakfast as I could hear her stomach relentlessly growling. \
I was a little late that day so I brought a bagel with me to eat on the commute. I felt kinda bad so I offered her half of my bagel \
and it\'s been our thing ever since. Today however, I was out of bagels.',
'User: Sorry we just ran out. I\'ll make sure to get some on my way home today.',
'Rebecca: You better. I don\'t know how I\'ll survive without them. The ones you bring always taste better for some reason.',
'User: I get them at a bakery not many people know about. Maybe I\'ll take you there someday. They\'re a lot better when they\'re fresh.',
'Of course that probably wasn\'t going to happen. It\'s not like we talk to each other beyond this morning commute.',
'Rebecca: Yeah... I\'d like that.',
'The rest of the ride was the same as any other day. We talked about what we did the other day, our favourite TV shows, good restaurants \
in the area, anything really. Everything was the same but something felt a little different, though I couldn\'t tell what it was.',
'User: (Maybe it\'s the lack of bagel)',
'The time flew by as we talked and soon enough we arrived at Rebecca\'s stop.',
'Rebecca: Well, I\'m off. I\'m holding you to that offer m\'kay? Later, see\'ya tomorrow!',
'User: Mhm, see\'ya tomorrow.',

'User: (As serious as always huh..)',
'That just now was Lisa. When I first started working here she was assigned to train me. I was put into a team of about ten people or so \
with Lisa being our supervisor. Thanks to her and the rest of the team I was able to get up to speed and quickly be of use.',
'Lisa: ........ *click* *clack* ........\n.................. *ring* *ring*\n....Hello?...',
'After answering the phone, Lisa promptly gets up and walks away with a few folders in her hand. Perhaps she had a meeting today.',
'Lisa is almost the complete opposite of Becca. She\'s maybe 5\'8\" even without heels. Her long, straight, black hair complemented \
her serious attitude. Long eyelashes draped over her long thin eyes. Everything about her, from her appearance to her personality \
was as sharp as a razor blade. To put it in one word, she was beautiful.',
'Man: Looking at Lisa again, are ya?',
'This guy is Ben. He\'s a super outgoing \'bro\' type of person. He\'s got pretty short, brown hair and a pretty well defined \
face. Pretty attractive that guy, not that I\'d ever date him. If I ever saw him on the street I would never think he worked \
a white collar job.',
'User: Get off my back.',
'Ben: No need to get so hostile, it was just a question. Anyway how about we get something to drink after work today? I just found this great place the other day.',
'User: Sure, sure. I\'ve got nothing better to do. Just don\'t go too crazy like you did last time. I\'m never gonna live that shit down.',
'Ben: God, don\'t remind me. Let\'s take this chance to do a re-do of that night. Lisa\'s coming back so I\'ll take my leave. \
Meet me in front of the entrance after work \'kay?',
'I give him a slight nod as he turns and makes his way back to his desk.',
'The hours pass by as I click and clack my way across the keyboard, tackling a few odd jobs Lisa assigned to me.',
'User: (I wonder what I\'ll have for lunch today).',
'Even though I make breakfast in the morning, I don\'t have enough time to make a decent lunch nor do I really bother to make one \
the previous day. That being said, for lunch I frequent the convenience store because, well, it\'s convenient. \
Not to mention the food they sell is pretty good.',
'Before I leave, someone calls out to me.',
f'Lisa: Hey, {name}, I\'m assuming you\'re headed to the convenience store, right? Would you mind grabbing something for me? \
I\'ve got something urgent I need to take care of.',
'User: That\'s no problem. Do you have something specific in mind?',
'Lisa: Nope, you can get me whatever. Here, to cover the expense.',
'She hands me a nice, crisp 10 dollar bill.',
'Lisa: You can keep the change.',
'User: Ohh, nice one. You were pretty cool there Lisa.',
'Lisa: J-just hurry.',
'She was trying to hide it but I could tell she was blushing a little.',
'Despite her seemingly cold exterior, Lisa can be sensitive at times so I like to tease her a bit here and there. Though \
if I did it too much, she would probably have no trouble at all firing me.',
'User: Alright, I\'ll be on my way then.',
'Lisa: *Ahem* Thank you. I\'ll just be at my desk when you get back.',
'With that, she briskly makes her way back to her desk and immediately sets off to work.',
'User: (I guess I\'ll get going then).',
'............................',
'The city gets much more congested at this time which is one of the reasons I go to the convenience store. If I tried to go \
anywhere else, my lunch break would end before I got to eat anything.',
'User: (Hm.. I wonder what I should get today).',
'The cold, air-conditioned interior of the convenience store hits my face as soon as the doors open.',
'User: (Maybe I\'ll grab a sandwich. It\'d be easy for Lisa to eat while she works too).',
'As I\'m looking at the sandwich options displayed, a lady starts restocking and replacing products beside me.',
'User: (I haven\'t seen her here before, maybe she\'s a new hire).',
'Once she leaves, I resume picking out a sandwich and some drinks before heading to the counter to pay.',
'She was pretty though. She had her brown hair tied up in a tidy ponytail. Looks to me like the sporty type. From the looks \
of it, she had a good amount of muscle but it wasn\'t obtrusive in any way.',
'Because of my frequenting this place I got to know the people working here pretty well, almost to the point I\'d call them friends. The staff \
has never changed since the first time I shopped here from what I know.',
'User: (I hope I get the chance to talk to her).',
'I walk up to the counter and lo and behold, she was stationed behind the register waiting for me to come pay.',
'User: (The world works in mysterious ways huh).',
'I guess this is as good of a chance as any to make aquaintences with her. I walk up to the register with the two drinks and \
sandwiches I picked out for lunch. (I got simple club sandwiches and bottled tea by the way).',
'Woman: *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep*\nWIll that be all?',
'User: Yup. Say, are you new here?',
'The nametag on her chest read \'Chris\'.',
'Chris: Mhm, I just started late last week.',
'User: I thought so. I\'ll be coming here often so I hope we can get along.',
'Chris: I hope so too. So let\'s see.. your total comes out to $14.35.',
'I hand her the crisp ten dollar bill that Lisa gave me as well as some of my own change.',
'She quickly puts the cash into the register and bags up the food I bought into a small plastic bag.',
'User: Thanks miss.',
'Chris: Just call me Chris.',
f'User: Then call me {name}. Well I\'m off now.',
f'Chris: Come back soon {name}, alright?',
'User: Sure thing.',
'With that quick introductory exchange over with, I leave the convenience store and start heading back to the office.',
'................................',
'User: I\'m back.',
'Lisa: That took a little longer than I thought it would.',
'User: There was a new hire so I spent a little time talking to them.',
'I grab one of each of the sandwiches and bottles of tea I bought and hand them over to Lisa.',
'Lisa: Thanks.',
'She puts her lunch on her desk then gets up and turns to face me.',
'Lisa: I\'ll get straight to the point. We\'re quite shorthanded on a current project I\'m leading. There\'s no one else on \
this team I can get to help me as they\'re all working on projects of their own.',
'Lisa: I\'m not forcing you to help. You would be of great assisstance but it\'d be a lot of work on your end that you might \
not be used to just yet. It would only be for about a little over two weeks. If you do accept, I\'ll help you as much as I can.',
'Lisa: I\'ll give you some time to think about it as long as you can come up with an answer by the end of the week. \
That gives you about three days, is that okay?',
'User: Yes, that\'s enough time. I\'ll give it some thought at home today. Then, if that\'s all, I\'m off to eat lunch.',
'Lisa: Of course. Thank you again for buying this for me.',
'User: Was no problem at all.',
'As I turn to make my way back to my desk, I hear a faint sigh coming from Lisa\'s direction.',
'User: (I wonder if she\'s doing ok).',
'I\'ll have to make sure to properly think this through when I get home.',
'The rest of the day goes by without any major turbulence. Me and Ben meet up in front of the office builing after we\'re both finished \
with work for the day. He brought some of his other buddies and I got to know them a bit while we drank.',
'We ended up bar hopping quite a bit. I didn\'t drink much because it was a work night but even so, it was pretty late by the time I got home.',

while I\'m working on this project...)']

what little personal life I have.',

'User: (If I\'m going to do it I better do it right).',
'..............................',
'It\'s the day after I was asked by Lisa to help with a project. I woke up with no hangover whatsoever (thank god I chose not to drink).',
'I get out of bed and go about things the way I usually do. Brush my teeth, wash my face, get dressed, make breakfast, all the same. Except \
today I knew I was about dip my toes into work hell.',
'More than not wanting to do the work, I was worried that my performance would weigh the team down. The responsibility is \
pretty high but I\'ve already made my choice. I\'m going to help Lisa to the best of my ability (whatever my \'best\' is anyway).',

that I needed to tell Aiya that I\'ll probably be coming home later than usual.',

were roommates. So, we decided we would try and eat dinner together as often as possible. Of course, sometimes it wouldn\'t happen \
but we both made a genuine effort to try.',

'Aiya is definately not a morning person.',

some time this week.',

'User: I can tell you where the place is and you can get some yourself if you want.',
'Rebecca: Oh. That\'s alright, I understand. If you give the me the name of the bakery I can find it.',
'If I skimped out on this job I could probably have found the time to go but I\'ve got to do my best to make sure I don\'t bring \
the whole thing crashing down.',
'I give Becca the name of the bakery along with a few helpful landmarks to help her find it on the bus. We continue chatting \
away as usual until we reach her stop and we go our seperate ways.',

f'Lisa: Oh, {name}, did you need something?',
'User: I just came to tell you that I\'ll help you with that project you were telling me about.',
'Lisa: Really!? Oh, thank goodness. Honestly, I was worried about what I\'d do if you had declined.',
'Lisa: Although I\'m glad, I\'m also surprised you made the decision this quickly. I didn\'t expect an answer until at least \
tomorrow.',
'User: Well, after what you told me yesterday, It would feel like I was abondoning you if I didn\'t choose to help. I might \
even learn a thing or two from this.',
'Lisa: Alright, in return for your help I\'ll teach and help you to the best of my ability. It\'s the least I can do.',
'User: I\'m holding you to that alright? Don\'t hate me if you have to hold my hand through all this.',
'Lisa: W-why would I need to hold your hand!?',
'User: ..Oh, I meant it figuratively.',
'She really was sensitive on the inside.',
'Lisa: R-right.',
'Lisa: *Ahem* Alright then, wait for me after work today. I\'ll give you a run-through of what the project is and what \
you\'ll be doing.',

'I give her a quick thumbs up before briskly making my way back to my seat.',
'User: (Alright, let\'s power through this other stuff so I can focus on the project).',
'My hands fly across the keyboard. I even skipped lunch today in order to work more. By the end of the day, I managed to \
clear up most of what I was working on before.',
'User: (Mmgh...   Ahhhhh)',
'I stretched out my exhaustion and prepared to talk with Lisa.',
'Lisa: Good work today, as always.',
'Speak of the devil.',
'Lisa: You looked more focused today than usual. I noticed you even skipped out on lunch.',
'User: Yeah, I was trying to clear some stuff in case this project takes more time than I expect.',
'Lisa: Mm, that\'s good.',
'Lisa: Well, I\'ll get right to it. This project I was assigned to manage is a collaborative between us and another company. \
Explaining the details would take too much time and it wouldn\'t mean much to you so I\'ll skip over it.',
'Lisa: Basically, since we\'re shorthanded, we\'re all over the place in terms of our work. In other words, we\'re disorganized.',
'Lisa: I\'m able to manage the people but I can\'t exactly manage the work we\'re putting out.',
'Lisa: That\'s why I\'m going to have you compile and organize all the files and work, both digital and analog. It\'s \
not exactly a hard job but it may take you some time to get used to.',
'Lisa: Did you get all that?',
'User: Yes. I got the gist of it at the very least.',
'Lisa: Great. That saves me some trouble.',
'She was talking fairly quickly, most likely an effect from the time constraints. Thankfully, I was able to understand \
most of what she was telling me.',
'Lisa: Now that that\'s out of the way, I\'ll guide you through how to actually do what I told you to.',
'Lisa: Oh. Don\'t worry about overtime pay. You\'ll be appropriately compensated for this. It\'d be pretty wrong of me to deny \
you of pay after I\'ve asked so much of you.',
'I\'m a little more reassured now that I know I\'ll be getting direct guidence from Lisa but even then, the pressure in this \
situation is enormous. I really can\'t make any mistakes.'
'Lisa: Well, no use standing around. Let\'s get started, huh?',
'We spent the next few hours going through each and every step. Lisa explained each step with the utmost clarity, it was \
suprising how easy it was to understand what she was telling me. Any question I threw at her she threw right back, answered, \
neatly wrapped and topped up with a bow. Figuratively of course. While she was a really good teacher, she was by no means a \
magician.',
'Lisa: And that about wraps everything up. If you have any last question feel free to ask.',
'User: Nope, you explained everything great, plus, you\'ve already answered all my questions.',
'Lisa: I\'m glad.',
'Lisa: It\'s pretty late now. I still have a bit of stuff I need to take care of so you can leave first.',
'User: Alright. I wish you were my teacher back in school. I probably would\'ve paid more attention during class if you were.',
'Lisa: T-thank you. But y-you really should get going now. I think the next bus leaves in twenty minutes.',
'I glanced at my watch that read \'8:14\'.',
'User: Oh, you\'re right. Alright, well I\'ll be off. See you tomorrow.',
'Lisa: Mhm, bye.',
'I leave the office and make my way over to the bus stop. The air gets a little more chilly, but thankfully the bus comes soon after I \
reach the stop.',
'I get on the bus, sit down, and lean my head up against the window tired from all the information I had to digest today.',
'User: (It\'s barely been a day and I\'m already exhausted. I pray that everything at least runs smoothly from here on).',
'I close my eyes as the nearly empty bus takes me back home.',
'.........................................',
'From the next few days I made an effort to get to work earlier. For breakfast, I usually settled for a couple simple fried eggs \
and a slice of buttered toast. Aiya had no complaints whatsoever, that girl will eat anything.',
'After a quick and easy breakfast I went out and waited for the bus as usual.',
'Somedays I would bring some files I had organized at home the night before. This assignment was taking more time than I had \
anticipated.',
'I still talked to Becca everyday on the bus but on days I looked busy, like today, she gave me a little space to focus.',
'User: (Now, where did I put that paper?)',
'There\'s still about a week and a half left of work to do based on what Lisa told me but, at least for now, the work hasn\'t \
been anything I can\'t handle.',
'All I\'ve been doing is sorting out any papers or files I\'m handed into different groups to be sent out or stored.',
'Once again, as Lisa said, it wasn\'t difficult in the slightest but my goodness did it take ungodly amounts of time.',
'It was never enough to stay late after work to get stuff sorted but oftentimes it could continue late at night back at home.',
'Wake up.\nWork.\nSleep.\nRepeat.',
'Early mornings and late nights.',
'In essence this is what my average day looked like. After this is all over I\'m going to have the best, and first, bubble bath \
of my life.',
'The heavenly image of a hot bath fades away as another brutal work day starts.',
'.............................................'
'Ben: C\'mon Lisa! You can\'t keep workin\' yourself to death. Let\'s go out for a drink and relax a little, how does that sound?',
'Lisa: I don\'t have the time for things like that, especially right now. I have too much on my plate for an evening drink.',
'Looks like Ben\'s pestering Lisa first thing in the morning today. Honestly, where does he get his energy from? (I, for one, \
get mine from delicious coffee).',
'User: *Sip* Ahh...',
'User: (Mm, nothing beats coffee in the morning).',
'Ben: Y\'know, since the day I started working here, I\'ve never had a drink with you. Not even at company dinners. In fact, \
I don\'t think I see you anywhere besides work.',
'Ben had a point. Even among the seniors, people rarely see Lisa at social gatherings of any kind. Personally, I barely even see her \
talk to anyone outside of our team besides the miscellaneous people she has business meetings with.',
'Lisa: I-I\'m just not the biggest fan of-',
f'Lisa: -Oh! {name}! Perfect timing. I need to discuss something with you in regards to the project.',
'Ben: Wait- ...ah.',
'Ben: Curses for perfectly timed entrances!',
'I wonder if Ben has a \'dramatic\' gene in his DNA.',
'User: You alright there Lisa? I know Ben can be a little insufferable sometimes but he\'s a good guy.',
'Lisa: I know that. he does a lot of good work and he\'s always nice but he can be a little...',
'Lisa: ...intense to talk to.',
'I get that. Even I get tired of hearing him talk sometimes.',
'Lisa: Oh! I did actually need to talk to you about something though. Can you set aside some time at lunch?',
'User: Sure thing. I\'ll see you at lunch then.',
'Lisa: Mhm. Let\'s work hard again today.',
'User: (I wonder what she needs to talk to me about).',
'If it was anything super important she would probably go to someone more experienced than me. Since she IS going to me though I\'d have to \
assume it\'s something minor I\'ll need to do.',
'Just more work, as per usual.',
'Whatever the case, I\'ll deal with it at lunch.',
'...........................................................',
'The hours went by without a snag and lunch quickly approached',
'User: (Mgh.. Ahh-)',
'I\'ve gotten a lot faster at my regular work after taking on this special project. If I had to say why, it\'s just that \
I\'ve been consciously trying to finish as fast as possible so I have more time to work on the project. I guess I\'ve just \
naturally gotten better over time.',
'I finish up what I was working on and glance over at the clock.',
'User: (12:27... I guess I should be meeting with Lisa soon).',
'As if this was part of a script, Lisa strolls up beside me.',
'Lisa: Good work again today. You\'re getting faster every time I see you.',
'User: You noticed too huh? I guess this project has done some good for me at least.',
'Lisa: Is that so? If that\'s the case then I\'m glad. Here.',
'Lisa hands me a cup of fried chicken bites, a small desert pastry, and a bottle of water.',
'Lisa: I got you these. Don\'t worry about paying me back. Consider this a... show of my appreciation.',
'User: Then I\'ll gladly accpet. Thanks.',
'Lisa: Don\'t mention it. Eat up and I\'ll tell you about what I mentioned earlier.',
'I start munching on the food Lisa brought me while Lisa walks around and sits down beside me.',
'Lisa: We\'ve run into a few snags here and there with the project. Some important files were lost in relay.',
'Lisa: I can\'t outsource any more help so it\'s up to us to either retrieve them or replace them.',
'Lisa: I have to take responsibility as our company\'s representative and I\'m asking you to help because well, we\'re too short on people and time \
to ask someone else.',
'Lisa: I\'m sorry to spring this on you all of a sudden but the two of us are going to be spending a few late nights together here.',
'I\'ve gotten dragged into something much more troublesome than I expected. I did say I was going to help as much as I can but...',
'User: (This is not what I meant).',
'User: *Sigh* Alright. So, how are we supposed to fix this exactly.',
'Lisa: You\'re going to be tracing what we\'re missing and trying to find them. What you don\'t find I will replace myself.',
'Lisa: Don\'t worry if you can\'t find any missing files. It\'s not exactly the easiest or most straightforward task. \
It\'s my responsibility so I can replace all the missing files if need be.',
'If I had to say anything about Lisa, it\'d be about how much I respect and admire her. She is professionalism in every sense of \
of the word.',
'User: (I\'ve decided. I\'m going to find at least one of these damn files for her).',
'User: I guess we should get to work then. Time is most certainly not on our side.',
'I can see a wave of relief wash over Lisa\'s body. Maybe she was hesitant about coming to me for help again.',
'Then again, she really is asking a lot from someone who\'s basically still new here. I probably don\'t have even a clue \
of how much pressure she\'s under if she has this much to ask of me.',
'If this is something I can do to relieve some of that burden then that\'s what I\'ll do.',
'Lisa: Again, I\'m really sorry about all this. It\'s not what you signed up for, I know that, but-',
'User: Ahhh, it\'s fine, it\'s fine.',
'User: You don\'t have to do this all yourself.',
'A brief moment of silence falls upon us until Lisa says two simple words. Two words that make my heart flutter the tiniest bit.',
'Lisa: ...Thank you.',
'There isn\'t much time left in the lunch break. We exchange a couple words of farewell and head our seperate ways. At least for now.',
'...........................................',
'The work day passes as usual. I finish my quota early once again but today I\'ve got to spend the rest of my time thinking.',
'User: (How am I supposed to find anything like this?)',
'I guess the first step is to ask around and have people point me in a direction.',
'Lisa had introduced me to a few people that were also working on this project before. Luckily enough, the one who was in charge of \
the lost files was one of those people I met. We\'ve only met once but, if I remember correctly, he works on the same floor as I do.',
'User: (Maybe he can give me some insight on where and how to look).',
'Just before the day is over, I navigate my way towards the man\'s desk.',
'After a bit of looking around, I find the man. He didn\'t look very old, maybe a few years older than me. He kept his hair on the short end, \
though not to the point of a calling it a buzz cut.',
'It looks like he\'s noticed me. He raises his head up from his computer to look at me, as if to confirm that I was approaching him.',
'Man: Hi, can I help you with something?',
'User: Hi, yeah, we\'ve met before.',
'Man: Oh, you\'re the guy Lisa came by with before, huh. You\'re probably here to discuss the files then, right?',
'User: You guessed it. If you have the time, I was hoping you could give me some sort of direction on where and how to look.',
'Man: Right, right. Well the day\'s almost done so if you stick around for a little then I\'ll give you what I can.',
'User: Thank you. I was really lost on what I was supposed to do.',
'Man: Don\'t mention it. Besides, it IS my fault afterall and I\'m not even the one cleaning it up.',
'User: That may be the case but I know you\'re probably up to your knees in work. You don\'t know how many time I\'ve heard the term \
\'shorthanded\' this past week.',
'Man: Haha, you\'ve got that right. Anyway, I\'ll do what I can to make it easier for you but-',
'User: It\'ll still be a lot of work. I know, I know.',
'Man: Well as long as you know. Alright, take a seat right over there.',
'He points to a chair by a desk a little to the right of his own.',
'Man: Give me ten minutes and I\'ll get to you, okay?',
'User: Sounds good.',
'After the wait, this senior of mine takes me through the ins and outs of the history of the file. He also gives me some tips and \
tricks on finding the file.',
'After a while of explaining and guiding, he had to catch the bus home. And thus I was left on my own.',
'User: *Sigh* (What am I going to do...)',
'Lisa: Good work today.',
'User: Oh, Lisa. Yeah, good work.',
'Lisa: What are you doing around here?',
'User: Oh right, I had someone walk me through how to find these lost files.',
'User: But honestly, I still haven\'t got a clue where to start.',
'Lisa: Don\'t worry about it too much. I told you before, I can handle things if need be.',
'That\'s what she says but I know even she has her limits.',
'User: I\'ll figure it out. Just leave it to me.',
'Lisa: ...Thank you...',
'The tension in Lisa\'s face dissipates for a split second before returning to the professional expression she usually wears.',
'User: Well, if we\'re going to be here a while I might as well get us something to eat. You don\'t mind convenience store food right?',
'Lisa: No, not at all. Thanks for offering. I\'ll get on to work then.',
'User: Alright, I\'ll only be a second.',
'Lisa walks over to her desk and plops down while I start making my way towards the convenience store.',
'.............................',
'I don\'t go to the convenience store as much as I used to anymore. Instead I started to pack a small lunch for myself \
in the mornings whenever I could. However, at least for the foreseeable future, I think I\'ll be visiting a little more often.',
'Woman: Welcome!',
'Oh, look what we have here. I didn\'t think Chris would still be working at this hour.',
'User: Evening, Chris.',
f'Chris: Oh, {name}, it\'s you. Haven\'t seen you around as often lately.',
'User: Yeah, I\'ve been up to my neck in work and it just got worse. That\'s actually why I\'m here today.',
'Chris: Ohh, staying late, huh. Sounds rough.',
'User: Now, I\'m not saying it\'s rough, I\'m just saying I could use a long massage right about now.',
'Chris: Well, it\'s no massage but you can take one of those drinks over there for free. Don\'t worry, my boss won\'t mind.',
'User: I\'ll take you up on that. Thanks.',
'I grab two pre-made lunches from the shelves and two bottles of tea. One pork set and one one chicken set. You don\'t see these \
kinds of things in convenience store often but it really should be more common. I mean these lunches are REALLY convenient.',
'Chris: Two?',
'User: Oh, yeah. For me and a colleague of mine.',
'Chris: Ahh, I see.',
'On the ground behind the desk is a large plastic bag with some sort of box inside.',
'User: Hey, what\'s that?',
'I point to the box-containing bag.',
'Chris: This? It\'s a Gunpla, you know, those plastic mech models. I\'ve been getting into them recently. I guess it\'s a new hobby.',
'User: Oh yeah, I\'ve heard of those before. They look pretty cool.',
'Chris: And they\'re super fun to build. You should try it sometime.',
'User: Hm, maybe in the future but I\'m too busy right now.',
'Chris: That\'s a shame. If you do build one in the future, be sure to let me know. I can give you some tips and tricks.',
'User: I will be sure to do that.',
'Chris: Great! Anyway, that\'ll be $17.35.',
'Chris finishes ringing up my stuff and I hand her a twenty dollar bill from my wallet.',
'I thank her again for the drinks and then I start making my way back to the office. I don\'t want to keep Lisa waiting for too long.',
'..................................',
'User: I\'m back!',
'When I get back, a lot of the lights are turned off. Just a few here and there around my office space.',
'Lisa: Hey, that was fast.',
'User: I told you I\'d only be a second.',
'User: Here. You want pork or chicken?',
'I hold out a lunch box in each of my hands.',
'Lisa: I\'ll take the chicken.',
'User: Coming right up.',
'I hand her the chicken set and a bottle of tea while I open up my own pork set.',
'Lisa: We can start after we get our fill.',
'We spend the next fifteen minutes or so filling up for the long night ahead.',
'...................................',
'Lisa: Alright, with that out of the way, shall we?',
'User: I guess there\'s no getting around it.',
'Lisa: Follow me then.',
'Lisa leads me over to what looks like a small meeting room across the office. It\'s got the frosted glass walls and everything.',
'Lisa: Nobody\'s using it right now so I figured we could work in here.',
'It\'s my first time being in a room like this but it\'s pretty much exactly like I imagined it.',
'User: Well, I guess it beats working out there in that gloomy atmosphere.',
'The room was brightly lit up unlike the rest of the office. You probably would be able to even tell it was this late from in here.',
'Lisa: Right? I\'ve already got everything set up in here for us while you were out. So let\'s get right to it.',
'I take a sit beside Lisa in front of the computer the put there.',
'User: (Let\'s see here...)',
'Lisa\'s taken it upon herself to recreate one of the files we\'re missing. There are still two others though so preferably I want \
to find at least one of them.',
'From what my senior told me, I should try and retrace the steps he took.',
'First, the files get sent to a hub to get ready to be sent out. Each file has a sender and a recipient listed.',
'Realistically, if the file wasn\'t sent out, it probably didn\'t even reach the hub so my first step is to check where else \
it could have gone.',
'Although, if it got sent somewhere it wasn\'t supposed to it\'d be impossible to find.',
'I start my search hoping that this won\'t be a fruitless effort.',
'..................................',
'After a few hours of searching with nothing to show for it, I start getting a little frustrated.',
'User: *Sigh*',
'Lisa: You alright over there?',
'At this point, Lisa has finished about half of a file. Compared to me who hasn\'t even gotten their footing down.',
'User: This is a lot trickier than I thought it\'d be.',
'Lisa: Let\'s take a break then. I was about ready for a breather anyway.',
'Lisa: How about we play a game? You know, for a change of pace.',
'User: You say that but,',
'I look around the empty room we\'re sitting in.',
'User: What do you suppose we do?',
'Lisa: *Chuckle*',
'As if she was waiting for that answer, Lisa reaches into her bag to reveal Bintendo Switch.',
'Lisa: Do you play Super Smash Pals?',
'User: Yeah, I\'ve played before but I\'m more suprised you play.',
'Lisa: I\'ve played with some people from the office and every time they would say that same thing.',
'Lisa: Is it that strange?',
'User: Um, it\'s less \'strange\' and more \'unexpected\'. I mean, and I\'m sure I speak for everyone, you always look so \
professional. It\'s a little hard to imagine you playing games at all.',
'Lisa: I will admit, I don\'t play very often and I\'m not very good but I do enjoy them',
'User: Well, thinking about it now, I can understand that.',
'Lisa: So?',
'Lisa holds out one of the detatched controllers in  my direction.',
'User: Well, I guess there\'s no harm in a little indulging.',
'I haven\'t played in a while so I\'m not sure what\'s new in this version but it should be fun nonetheless.',
'User: Hm, I guess I\'ll play Zelba.',
'Lisa: I can only play Plum so I\'m glad you didn\'t choose her.',
'User: Alright, let\'s get to it then.',
'Lisa: I\'ll warn you, I\'ve beaten everyone I\'ve played against.',
'User: I thought you said you weren\'t good at games?',
'Lisa: SSP is another story.',
'User: Alright, alright. We\'ll see about that.',
'A few minutes later...',
'Lisa: H-how could I lose, and not only that...',
'I three-stocked her.',
'User: W-well, I used to play this game a lot so...',
'Lisa: Unacceptable.',
'User: .',
'User: ..',
'User: ...',
'User: ...Huh?',
'Lisa: Rematch. I demand a rematch.',
'Lisa\'s face has suddenly turned ice cold. Her glare pierces a hold straight through me. Scary.',
'User: Uh, I\'ll be honest. It probably won\'t go much better for you even if-',
'Lisa: Silence.',
'Her voice put an inasane pressure over me. To think she would get like this over a game.',
'Lisa: Let\'s play.',
'And so, we played a few more matches and...',
'Lisa: ...ustrating.',
'Lisa was mumbling something under her breath.',
'Lisa: So frustrating.',
'Needless to say, I beat her three more times. Though she did take a stock off me one of the games.',
'User: H-hey, there\'s nothing to be mad about. You don\'t play this game that much right?',
'Lisa: ...',
'Lisa: Hey.',
'I\'m a little worried about what she\'s about to say. Is she that mad at me?',
'User: W-what is it?',
'Lisa: Teach me how to play.',
'User: I\'m sorry, alright? I didn\'t think you\'d get this ma-',
'User: ...What?',
'Lisa: You\'re good at this game so... can you teach me?',
'User: Um, sure, I guess? But why do you want to learn so bad?',
'Lisa: I, uh, want to show off a little...',
'Lisa: Just a little! This game\'s a lot of fun so I want to get even a little better.',
'User: Well, I have nothing against teaching you but...',
'We just spent the last hour or so playing so we\'ve fallen a little behind schedule.',
'Lisa: Oh! *Ahem*. Of course, we should be getting back to work. There is still a lot to do after all.',
'Aaaaaaand she\'s back to the usual.',
'User: This was a lot of fun though, really needed this break.',
'Lisa: Indeed it was.',
'We get back to it for a couple more hours. I manage to get an idea on where to find this missing file but we\'re \
wrapping it up for tonight.',
'If this keeps up, we might be able to finish up sooner than later. Tomorrow even.',
'Lisa: Alright then, I\'ll see you tomorrow. Good work today, I mean it.',
'User: Thanks. Super Smash Pals was really fun. Let\'s play again once all this is over.',
'Lisa: You got it!',
'We leave the office building and go our seperate ways. Thankfully, the buses are still running at this hour.',
'After waiting about fifteen minutes, I get on the bus and head home.',
'I got to see a different side of Lisa today. Despite all the work, not a bad day I\'d say.',
'User: (Not a bad day at all...)',
'......................................',
'A couple days later...',
'User: Is this it?',
f'Lisa: You found it! Good job {name}!',
'I\'m working overtime again with Lisa. It\'s been two days since the time we played Smash and I\'ve finally found the file I\'ve been looking for.',
'I ran into some troubles yesterday but I managed to figure it out in the end.',
'User: Thank god. I was beginning to think it was gone forever.',
'Lisa: How about we celebrate a little? I\'ll go and grab a beer for us.',
'User: You know what, I could use a drink. Thanks.',
'Lisa: Alright, wait right right here.',
'She briskly makes her way ot the door. Looks to me like Lisa\'s been looking forward to this drink more than I am.',
'I just realized this but I\'ve been spending a lot of time with Lisa. Even though it\'s been hell, it\'s also been fun \
working with her.',
'Suddenly I think about playing Smash.',
'User: (Man. That really was fun).',
'I hope she\'s having too.',
'I glace around the room looking at the frosted glass or potted plants. I space out for a little while, staring at things, \
until finally, the sound of approaching footsteps snaps me out of it.',
'Lisa: I\'m back. I got us a few beers each and some snacks to go with them.',
'I let out a small smile before cracking open one of the beers.',
'User: *Glug* *glug* *glug* ...Ahhhh...',
'User: Man, did I need some of this.',
'Lisa: Haha, don\'t get too comfortable now. We still have work to do.',
'User: Oh right. I totally forgot about the reason I\'m here at all.',
'User: Just when I thought it was over...',
'Lisa: Now, now. Silver lining is it\'s smooth sailing from here. We should be able to finish the rest of the work in a few days or so.',
'Lisa: So let\'s enjoy ourselves for a little before getting back to it.',
'Lisa: Cheers, to a job well done!',
'User: Cheers!',
'We drink for a couple hours or so chatting away the tension built up from work. Soon enough it almost became eleven at night and \
we both decided that that was enough drinking for a work night.',
'We only got a little tipsy because a hangover would definitely not be good for work the next day.',
'We head out of the office together. Outside, Lisa manages to grab a cab and I made it to the bus stop just in time.',
'We say our farewells as we both head on home.',
'As Lisa said, the rest of the week went by unbelievably smooth. Just a few small hiccups along the way.',
'It\'s been a rough two weeks but in the end we made it through without much difficulty. Starting tomorrow, my life gets a lot less \
hectic but right now, it\'s time for a bubble bath.',

'I try and brainstorm as many ideas as possible while I work away at the office today. Lunch time comes yet I still haven\'t \
come up with any decent ideas.',
'Why are hobbies so hard to come up with anyway?',
'Hopefully Lisa has a hobby that\'d interest me.',
'Speaking of which, lunch time is coming up soon and I still need to inform Lisa of my decision.',
'As soon as lunch comes around, I get up from my desk and make my way over to Lisa\'s.',
'User: Good work today.',
f'Lisa: Oh, {name}. Yes, good work today too. What brings you over here?',
'It\'s about the thing you told me yesterday.',
'Lisa: This quickly? Well, the earlier the better I suppose. So?',
'User: I don\'t think I can do it. It feels like too much responsibility and honestly, I didn\'t realize how much my \
time meant to me until now.',
'User: I hope it doesn\'t cause you too much trouble.',
'Lisa: Don\'t worry about it. I was expecting this kind of answer. I guess it was a pretty long shot to ask a fairly recent \
hire to do something like this.',
'Lisa: Don\'t worry about me either, by the way. I\'ll be able to handle just fine.',
'User: If you ever want to ask me to do some small tasks for you I\'d be more than happy to help. Just this one is a little \
too far out of my comfort zone.',
'Lisa: I understand. Now go and have some lunch, I don\'t want to keep you too long.',
'User: Alright, I\'ll be going then. Good luck, for what it\'s worth.',
'Lisa: Thank you.',
'I blink and Lisa\'s already back to work. She really is something else. If anyone else told me they could handle this stuff \
I might not believe them.',
'Maybe If I had chose to help her I could\'ve learned a thing or two.',
'Well now\'s not the time for regrets, I\'ve still got a problem I\'ve got to deal with myself.',
'User: *Sigh*',
'Well, can\'t eat on an empty stomach. I guess I\'ll take a trip to the convenience store again.',
'.......................................................',
'Chris: Hi, how can I help you?',
'User: Hey, Chris.',
f'Chris: Oh! {name}! How are you doing?',
'User: Mm.. I guess I\'m doing alright.',
'Chris: Hmm.. alright then.',
'Chris: Well, I\'ll be right over here when you\'re done.',
'User: I won\'t be long.',
'Chris: Oh, right. One more thing. We just got some new stuff around the back if you want to try some of it.',
'User: Okay, I\'ll give it a shot.',
'I take this oppritunity to try something new. Maybe something new is what I need to get some ideas for a hobby.',
'User: (Let\'s see... it should be over here...)',
'User: (Oh!)',
'There is an abundance of new sandwiches on display among the other, older ones.',
'In this wall of sandwiches, one of the labels reads, \'Chicken Parmesan\'.',
'I\'ve never actually had chicken parm before so I\'m a little curious to try it.',
'I grab the sandwich and a bottle of iced coffee from the shelf and make my way back to the register.',
'User: Yo.',
'Chris: Hey, you got everything?',
'User: Yup. I was honestly surprised how many new things there were.',
'Chris: *Beep* Tell me about it. *Beep* My boss came up to me yesterday telling me we had new items to stock.',
'Chris: Imagine my surprise when all this stuff came in.',
'User: Well, I appreciate you working hard so that I can get my lunch here everyday.',
'Chris: Ahh, don\'t mention it. But it does feel nice hearing that once in a while. Thanks.',
'Chris: Anyway, Your total is $7.35.',
'I tap my card against the card reader and wait for the beep before I take my card off.',
'As I put my card back into my wallet, I glance over the counter beside where Chris is standing.',
'User: Hm? What\'s in that box down there?',
'Chris stops bagging my food and looks over her shoulder to where I\'m pointing.',
'Chris: Huh? Oh, this?',
'She pulls out a large box with pictures of a humanoid mech printed on it from the bag on the floor.',
'Chris: I\'ve been getting into building Gunpla recently. This is my third one I think?',
'User: Yeah, I\'ve seen those around here and there. They do look pretty cool.',
'Wait.',
'Time consuming. Check.',
'Decorative. Check.',
'Plus, there\'s someone I can discuss it with.',
'Chris: I got this one just now while I was on break. I actually got back just before you came in.',
'User: How long does it usually take to build one of these?',
'Chris: Well from what I\'ve read online, it can really vary depending on what you\'re building.',
'Chris: Right now I\'m only building some of the simpler ones.',
'Chris: You interested?',
'User: Maybe a little. I\'ve been trying to find a new hobby to get into recently and I was thinking that \
this might be a good idea.',
'Chris: Well, if you do decide to go through and build one yourself, let me know! I\'d be happy to help in \
whatever way I can.',
'User: Alright, got it.',
'Chris: Well here\'s your stuff,',
'She hands me the food she was bagging before I mentioned her Gunpla.',
'User: Thanks. I\'ll see you later.',
'Chris: Mhm, later.',
'I leave the convenience store and return to the office where I eat the lunch I bought.',
'I totally forgot about the new chicken parm sandwich I bought today.',
'This was what I was excited for before Chris told me about Gunpla.',
'User: (Gunpla, huh...)',
'I contemplate the idea Chris gave me today. It does fit the criteria that I wanted, and even better, \
there\'s someone else that I can discuss with.',
'I think about it a little while longer as I take my first bite into the sandwich.',
'User: (Mm... delicious).',
'...........................................',
'It\'s the morning after I had my little discussion with Chris.',
'When I got home that night I did a little bit of research on Gunpla.',
'Different types, where to buy them, how to build them, things like that.',
'Fortunately for me, we live in an era where it\'s really easy to find information on just about anything.',
'I found a forum online where a whole bunch of people talk about their builds and ask questions and stuff.',
'I went on the forum last night to post some questions but I haven\'t checked the thread yet. I was planning to \
do that when I got home from work today.',
'Speaking of work, Lisa messaged me to tell me she found someone who could help her, so I can rest easy there.',
'Besides this \'hobby finding\' thing, that\'s what I was worried about the most.',
'After I finish my breakfast I get dressed and head off to work. I wonder if Ben knows anything about Gunpla.',
'I guess I\'ll ask him when I see him.',
'The bus arrives after about a ten minute wait.',
'Ben: Mornin\'.',
'User: Morning, Ben.',
'Ben: How\'s that hobby hunting of yours going? Find anything interesting yesterday?',
'User: Actually, about that, do you know anything about Gunpla?',
'Ben: You mean those model robot things? I think I had a friend in college that used to build some.',
'Ben: It\'s essentially model building, right? I guess it does check off everything you wanted.',
'User: Yeah, I heard about them from someone who works at the convenience store I always go to for lunch.',
'Ben: Oh, that place? I remember you took me there before one time. I did remember they had a bunch of good \
stuff there.',
'User: Exactly. Plus, they got some new items recently. I tried one of the new sandwiches and it was really, \
really good. I might try something else new toda-',
'User: Wait we\'re getting off topic.',
'Ben: Right, right. Gunpla. I don\'t know anything about them myself.',
'User: What about your college friend?',
'Ben: Maybe I used \'friend\' too liberally there. We just sat next to each other in a class.',
'Ben: We got along well but I don\'t even have his phone number. Sorry.',
'User: Ah, don\'t worry about it. I was just asking in case you knew something.',
'Ben: If I do find something out, I\'ll let you know but don\'t count on it.',
'User: Gotcha.',
'I glance over at the clock on the wall.',
'User: Oh, crap. Our shift\'s about to start.',
'User: I\'m going to rush out a cup of coffee, I\'ll see you later.',
'Ben: Got it.',
'After frantically putting together a nice(?) cup of coffee, my work day starts up.',
'...............................................',
'It\'s lunch time and once again I\'m headed to the convenience store.',
'Ben: Wait up!',
'User: Hm? Do you need something?',
'Ben: That talk about the convenience store earlier today made me crave some of it. Do you mind getting \
something for me too while you\'re there? I\'ll pay you back of course.',
'User: I don\'t mind. Did you want anything specific?',
'Ben: Just get me whatever you get.',
'User: Alright, no problem.',
'Ben: Thanks man. You\'re the best.',
'User: I\'ll be back in a bit, alright?',
'User: (I guess I\'ll try some more of the new items today).',
'One more thing to think about as I head over to the convenience store for the day.',
'..................................................',
'Chris: Hey, about time you showed up.',
'User: Hey, Chris.',
'Chris: So, did you look into any Gunpla stuff?',
'User: Huh? Oh, yeah I did. I looked around on some forums and stuff.',
'User: Everyone is pretty nice and helpful actually.',
'Chris: Right? I don\'t think I could\'ve finished it if it weren\'t for them.',
'User: Are you good at building things?',
'Chris: I don\'t know. I\'ve never really been into stuff like Legos when I was a kid so I haven\'t done it enough to say \
if I\'m good or bad.',
'User: So then how did you end up building Gunpla?',
'Chris: We can save that for another time. You\'re here for lunch, right?',
'User: Right, right. I almost forgot about that. Are the new items still around the back?',
'Chris: Mhm. They\'re in the same spot. We are going to move them next week though, just FYI.',
'User: Alright, I\'ll remember that.',
'User: The chicken parm sandwich was pretty good by the way. You should try it when you get the chance.',
'Chris: Will do.',
'Today, I bought two sets of sushi. I\'m not exactly sure but I think it\'s squid? Either way it looks \
good, plus, Ben is a sucker for sushi.',
'I go back to the office, share my lunch with Ben, and work as usual for the rest of the day.',
'Work actually ended a bit earlier today.',
'It\'s going to take a little while before the bus comes so I decide to explore a little bit.',
'Despite working in this area, I\'ve never gotten the chance to see what\'s around.',
'User: (Hm?)',
'In the distance is a store I don\'t think I\'ve seen before.',
'I decide to walk over and see what it sells.',
'The sign board hanging above the double-door entrance read, \'HOLO\'. Well that doesn\'t give me any clues \
as to what they sell.',
'I check my watch and it seems like I have enough time to pop in for a bit.',
'User: (Well then... let\'s see...)',
'When I walk through the door I\'m greeted by mountains upon mountains of boxes of different sizes. Each detailed \
with a different images ranging from cartoony to gruesome and everything inbetween.',
'I feel like a fish out of water.',
'Man: Welcome, can I help you with anything?',
'Suddenly, a man in uniform approaches me. I can only assume he works here.',
'User: Uh, hi. I was just curious and decided to look inside.',
'Man: Alright, let me know if need anything.',
'With that, the staffer began to walk off.',
'Actually, now that I think about it, I wonder if they have any Gunpla related stuff.',
'User: Actually, I have one question.',
'Man: Yes?',
'User: Do you, by any chance, have any Gunpla?',
'Man: As a matter of fact, we do. It\'s right over there, in that corner.',
'The man pointed to one of the back corners of the store.',
'User: Alright, thanks.',
'Man: No problem.',
'He goes back to doing his rounds and I make my way to the corner.',
'As I get closer, display cases filled with different models come into view.',
'Robots of different shapes, sizes, and colours populated this section of the room. Looks like \
this area is made specifically for Gunpla.',
'I never new these models were THIS popular.',
'I snap out of my mesmerization when I realize that I still had a bus to catch.',
'With about five minutes to spare, I made it back to the bus stop.',
'Woman: Oh?',
'There\'s a woman who\'s already waiting for the bus when I get there.',
'User: (Wait, is that...?)',
f'Woman: Is that you {name}?',
'What a coincidence.',
'User: What are you doing here Chris?',
'The woman waiting at the same stop I am is Chris.',
'Chris: I just finished my shift so I\'m heading home now.',
'User: What a coincidence. I got off early so I\'m heading home as well. Actually,',
'I remember that I just visited a toy shop and decide to let Chris know.',
'User: Actually, I had a bit of time to spare so I was exploring around and I found this toy shop nearby that \
sells Gunpla.',
'Chris: Oh! Are you talking about HOLO?',
'User: Yeah, yeah, that one.',
'Chris: That\'s actually where I first discovered them.',
'User: I was surprised to find a whole section dedicated to Gunpla.',
'Chris: Yeah, they\'re actually really popular.',
'User: Being in there and actually seeing the models made me want to buy one.',
'Chris: Oho... is that so?',
'The bus came quickly after our short exchange.',
'It turns out Chris\' bus was actually the one after mine so we said our farewells at the stop.',
'The bus ride home was nothing special but the whole way, my mind was filled with images of those plastic models in \
those glass cases.',
'....................................................',
'When I get home, I make dinner with whatever leftovers we have in our fridge. I let Aiya know that dinner \
is ready and then bring my own portion into my room.',
'I turn on my computer and check back on the forums while I eat dinner to see if I\'ve gotten any responses',
'User: (Hm?)',
'I notice a notification on the site that I\'m using.',

'It\'s a well made guide that another user put together.',
'It has everything from types of models to how to assemble them.',
'I scroll until I find the section talking about materials and tools you need.',
'Apparently, you need a few extra tools like a boxcutter or a file and paint if you want.',
'I ask around for some help again and was told that painting was something I could do if I wanted to \
add more to my model.',
'I thought about it and decided it\'d be best if I just focused on building it as a first goal.',
'asterale told me that I should build a \'real grade\'? 1/144? I\'m not exactly sure what those terms mean \
so I scroll over to the \'model\' section of the guide.',
'What I find out is that \'real grade\' refers to a type of model and 1/144 refers to the scale of the model.',
'1/144 is the smallest so it\'s recommended for beginners',
'I guess I\'ll take some time this weekend to visit the shop again. I want to at least narrow down my choices \
a bit.',

convenience store again.',

'User: It is, isn\'t it?',
'User: I\'ll try something new again and I\'ll tell you how it is next time.',
'Chris: Alright. Don\'t take too long, okay?',
'User: Yeah, I\'ll be just a second.',
'I quickly grab something at random and bring it to the front where Chris is waiting.',
'Chris: A lunch set, huh?',
'What I had picked out just now was a lunch set consisting of poached lobster, bread, and coleslaw.',
'I didn\'t even know food like this could exist in a convenience store.',
'User: You know, this store has one of the widest ranges of food I know. And it\'s a convenience store at that.',
'Chris: I guess that\'s what we pride ourselves on.',
'User: You should. It\'s surprisingly impressive.',
'Chris takes my food and begins ringing it up.',
'Chris: Have you decided on a model you want to build yet?',
'User: No, not yet. I was planning to go looking at that store sometime on the weekend.',
'Chris: I see...',

'User: (Hmm...)',
'I might as well now that I\'ve said it.',

it\'d be fun.',

weekend.',

f'Chris: Alright. Have a good one {name}.',
'Man, I can\'t wait for this weekend.',

'Three days later and it\'s the day before I\'m supposed to meet with Chris.',
'Chris messaged me the other night and we managed to plan everything pretty quickly.',
'Tomorrow is Saturday and me and Chris are meeting up in front of the store at 1pm.',
'Originally, we were only supposed to look around and buy a Gunpla but Chris suggested we might as well eat \
lunch as well. Of course, I wasn\'t opposed.',
'First thing\'s first, I\'ve got to make sure Aiya is gonna be okay for lunch tomorrow.',
'I usually make lunch on the weekends so Aiya\'ll probably just have to go out to eat.',
'User: Aiya!',
'Aiya: Mmm...?',
'Out of her room comes a groggy and half-awake Aiya. She\'s still dressed in pajamas despite it being two in the afternoon.',
'User: I\'m going out tomorrow and I won\'t be back until dinner. You\'ll have to grab lunch without me.',
'Aiya: Whaaaaaaaaaaat? Man, okay...',
'User: Sorry. But you\'ll be fine, it\'s just for lunch so I\'ll be back to make dinner.',
'Aiya: Alright, I\'m going back to sleep then.',
'And so, the groggy and half-awake Aiya retreats back into her room.',
'Well, with that out of the way, I guess I\'ll spend some time looking around for a Gunpla to buy.',
'Chris and I are going to be looking tomorrow as well but it\'s probably a good idea to get an idea of what to look for.',
'I log on to the forum I used earlier and scour around looking at other people\'s builds.',
'A lot of them have custom paint jobs or custom pieces. I hope I\'ll have enough skill and time to manage something like that one day.',

'The store is a short walk away from my office, so it shouldn\'t take me long to get there granted the bus ride \
takes the same amount of time it always does.',
'What can I do to kill an hour and a half?',
'Actually, even though we said we were going to get lunch, we never specified where we were going to get it.',
'Luckily for me, I had an hour and a half to conjure up some last minute preperations.',
'......................................................',
'A short bus ride and some walking later and here I am in front of HOLO.',
'I\'m still around ten minutes ahead of schedule.',
'Regarding the food issue, I managed to find a pretty nearby bakery that sells handmade sandwiches. I\'ve \
heard good things about it so that\'s something I\'m excited for.',
'I wait another five or so minutes until I see a small figure walking towards me.',
'User: Hey, Chris.',
'Chris: Hi, I\'m not late, am I?',
'User: Nope. You\'re still early actually.',
'Chris: That\'s good. Let\'s get going then.',
'User: You want to grab lunch first?',
'Chris: Right! We didn\'t decide on a place to eat earlier.',
'User: Don\'t worry. I realized that before I left and found a place nearby. How do sandwiches sound?',
'Chris: Sounds good to me.',
'The sandwich place is about a ten or so minute walk from where we are.',
'Chris searches up their menu and we decide our order while we make our way there.',
'Suddenly, after we\'re done discussing our lunch, Chris and I start talking about Gunpla.',
'Chris: And so, I spent a good while last night looking for some models to recommend you.',
'User: Did you find anything? I was looking around myself but I only managed to find a few on my own.',
'User: But there was somebody from the forums that ended recommending me some models too.',
'Chris: You\'re managing to get a surprising amount of people to help you out.',
'User: Actually, it\'s just this one person that\'s been helping me out a lot.',
'At this point we\'re just entering the bakery.',
'Chris: Really?',
'Chris: Well you can tell me about it while we eat.',
'With that being said, Chris and I take our time to order our food.',
'Chris gets one of their grilled chicken sandwiches while I opt for a meatball sub.',
'Thankfully, this place isn\'t very busy today so we only have to wait about five minutes to get our food.',
'User: I heard good things about this place but man, this looks really good.',
'Chris: Yeah, I\'ve never heard of this place before but I might have to come back after today.',
'We sit at a small, round table for two by the window and start eating.',
'Chris: *Mgh* ...So, what were we talking about?',
'User: Oh, right. I was just saying there was basically just one person helping me with everything.',
'Chris: Sounds like they have too much time on their hands.',
'User: You\'re probably right.',
'User: Basically, they just helped me get my footing. Linked me forum posts and all that.',
'Chris: Crap, why didn\'t I think of that. I completely forgot to show you some of my favourites.',
'User: I mean, you can still show me. I\'ll take all the help I can get.',
'Chris: Yeah, for sure. I\'ll send it to you later today.',
'I give Chris a thumbs up as I bite down into my sub.',
'User: Oh, and they even helped me pick out some Gunpla to look out for.',
'Chris: Ooh, like what?',
'I showed her some images that I had saved from last night.',
'Chris: Oh man, these are some great choices.',
'Chris: Actually, I\'ve been looking to get one of these myself.',
'User: Just don\'t get the same one I do.',
'Chris: What? Why not?',
'User: I don\'t know. Maybe it\'s the novelty of feeling like you\'re the only one that owns something.',
'Chris: You didn\'t need to get so philosophical but I get it.',
'Chris: Alright, I\'ll stay off your terf this one time.',
'User: Thanks.',
'The rest of our lunch is filled with idle chatter about what we\'ve been up to but soon enough, we finish our sandwiches.',
'User: Whew. The reviews weren\'t lying about this place.',
'Chris: That\'s for sure.',
'User: I guess it\'s about time we get going, huh.',
'Chris: Mhm, let\'s go.',
'I chose a place for lunch not too far from HOLO mainly because it\'s a pain to walk around here.',
'Thanks to that though, it only takes a couple minutes to make it to the store.',
'User: It\'s finally time.',
'User: I\'ve been waiting for this all week.',
'Chris: Well, let\'s get going then!',
'Chris pushes me through the doors into the wonderful world of toy shops.',
'Immediately, the cold air hits my face. I break away from Chris\' hands and walk towards the, occaisonally looking around \
at other toys and games displayed around.',
'A lot of this stuff looks pretty interesting. If I\'m not careful, I might end up buying more than I planned.',
'But there it is, looking as enticing as the first time I saw it.',
'I walk into the Gunpla section of the store. Some of the glass cases have different models than I saw last time I came here.',
'I walk through the small aisles, looping from time to time, just admiring all of the models.',
'I feel like a kid again, not that I\'m that old.',
'Chris is over in the corner looking at some Gunpla herself.',
'User: Hmm.. that ones pretty cool.',
'Chris: -Jesus. Tell me the next time you decide to sneak up on me.',
'User: My bad. Anyway, are you planning on buying anything today?',
'Chris: Probably not but it doesn\'t hurt to look right?',
'User: Fair enough.',
'Chris: And how about you? Have you decided which one you\'re going to buy?',
'I think so. I\'m jumping in between two of them but this one\'s too good to pass up on.',
'I show Chris the MBF-P01-Re2 I\'m holding in my hand.',
'Chris: Oooooh. That\'s nice.',
'Chris takes the box from my hand to take a closer look at the images.',
'User: It really hard to choose but I really like the black-gold colour scheme on this one.',
'Chris: Isn\'t there a white version of this one too?',
'User: Uh, I\'m not sure. This is the one I saw when I was searching around.',
'Chris: I\'m pretty sure there is. Hold on, gimme a second.',
'Chris runs off into the aisles and I\'m left just waiting awkwardly in the corner.',
'After about a minute she comes back with a box in her hands.',
'Chris: I found it!',
'User: There really is one, huh.',
'Chris: Maybe I\'ll buy this one so we can have a matching pair.',
'User: Hm?',
'Chris: To commemorate your first Gunpla.',
'User: If you\'re alright with spending $30 dollars for it.',
'Chris: It\'s fine, I\'ve been eyeing this model for a little bit anyway. Now I have a reason to actually buy it.',
'User: Well, if that\'s the case, let\'s do it.',
'Chris: Yeah! Alright, let\'s go check out.',
'User: Yup.',
'After Chris and I buy our models, we start walking towards her bus stop.',
'We\'ve been chatting a bit while on our way.',
'User: I\'ll have to buy some tools when I get home tonight.',
'Chris: Do you want me to send you a list?',
'User: That person sent me a link to a list but I\'m not sure if I still have it.',
'Chris: Alright, I\'ll send you what I use when I get home.',
'User: Thanks.',
'We\'ve been waiting at the bus stop for a little while and soon enough her bus arrives.',
'Chris: Alright, I\'ll see you around.',
'User: Mhm, bye.',
'After she gets on, I start making my way to my bus stop.',
'If the times are right, I should be there just about on time.',
'It\'s almost six so it\'s about time for dinner. The sun is setting and the air has gotten colder, but my excitement is still \
burning bright.',
'I can\'t wait to build this but let\'s get dinner out of the way first.',

'...So I decide to ask Aiya.',
'Aiya: Well for starters you could splurge. I hear retail therapy actually helps.',
'Retail therapy, huh..? I don\'t make that much money but I guess I could go and spend some. There are a few games I\'ve been wanting \
to buy. Maybe now\'s the perfect time.',
'Aiya: After that I guess you could go for a massage. It\'s a little cliche but it\'s a good way to relax.',
'It\'s massage after all. I mean, it\'s a classic for a reason.',
'Aiya: Last thing I can think of is a bath, maybe. I good bath helps me a lot.',
'Aiya: (Though sometimes I fall asleep in there).',
'Aiya mutters something under her breath but I can\'t hear it clearly enough to make out what she said.',
'User: (But a bath...)',
'I\'ve always preferred to just shower so I never really take any baths. It might be a nice change of pace.',
'Aiya: That\'s all I got for ya.',

'Aiya: No problemo.',
'I\'ve still got some work that\'s piled up but I think by next Saturday I\'ll be done with that.',
'With that, I head over to work.',
'Now that I think about it, I should probably tell Lisa about my desicion. She won\'t be happy about it though.',
'I make my way towards Lisa\'s desk and cut right to the chase.',

f'Lisa: Oh, {name}. What brings you here?',
'User: I came to tell you about that project you told me about yesterday. I thought about it and well...',
'I can tell Lisa\'s hoping for some help because her eyes are just overflowing with anticipation.',
'I still feel a little guilty about this but I really am not the person to ask for something as important as this.',
'User: I\'m sorry but I don\'t think I\'m cut out to help with something like that. I wouldn\'t want to hold anyone back or cause more trouble than there \
already is. Especially since I\'m still pretty new here.',
'Almost immediately does Lisa\'s face become downcast but I\'m a hundred percent sure there is at least one person better suited for this task than me.',
'Lisa: That\'s alright. I did tell you that I wasn\'t going to force you. I understand your desicion.',
'Lisa: Oh, and don\'t worry about me. I\'ll be sure to find someone else and even if I don\'t, I\'ll be able to get it done.',
'User: If there are any errands or things, do let me know. It\'s not like I won\'t help you at all.',
'Lisa: Mhm, I\'ll be sure to do that.',
'With that, I head back to my desk and get right to work.',
'I power through the rest of this week and next and finally, Saturday came.',
'................................................',
'On the morning of Saturday, I realize that I still haven\'t exactly decided the order of things.'
'User: (What should I do first?)',
'Obviously I\'m taking the bath last but between a massage and shopping I guess I should do the massage first. I wouldn\'t \
want to carry my shopping bags around with me everywhere.',
'With a plan formulated, I end up calling a massage parlor after I finish my breakfast and reserve a spot in the afternoon.',
'I did a little bit of research the night before on where exactly I should go. I also asked some colleagues of mine for their opinions.',
'Ultimately, I decided on a place closer to the heart of the city.',
'The place is a little pricy but hey, I\'m treating myself so why not? Plus, I don\'t go into the heart of the city too often. It\'ll \
be fun to just walk around and explore a little.',
'I laze around for the rest of the morning, playing games, watching TV, etc., and soon enough the time for my reservation was coming up.',
'Aiya already left a little while ago to hang out with her friends so I make sure to turn off all the lights before I leave.',
'...............................................',
'It\'s been so long since I\'ve been here I forgot how loud it got.',
'Despite the crowd, I end up being able to find the parlor without much trouble.',
'The atmosphere inside the building is a total 180 from the outside. Everything in here is so calming I almost want to fall \
asleep on the spot.',
'The massage itself is fantastic. It\'s one of those things where you don\'t really know you need it until you get it.',
'I thank the nice people working there before heading out back into the busy streets.',
'It almost feels like a waste ruining this perfectly good massage by going right out into a crowd of people right after.',
'I step out into the street and immediately I can see that the amount of people had increased greatly. People are practically \
walking shoulder-to-shoulder.',
'As luck would have it though, the game shop I was planning to go to isn\'t too, too far.',
'I step out into the crowd and instantly get assaulted by the masses of people.',
'Woman: Ah, I\'m sorry.',
'I bump into someone while walking.',
'User: No it\'s oka-',
'...Is that?',
f'Lisa: Oh, {name}. What are you doing here?',
'User: I could say the same to you.',
'Lisa: It\'s a little embarrassing but there\'s a game I wanted to buy.',
'User: Oh, what a coincidence. I was just on my way to a game store myself.',
'Lisa: Would you like to go together then? It\'s not often we meet outside of work.',
'User: Why not? I could use some company.',
'Lisa and I spend a while looking through the store\'s selection of games.',
'They had everything from the popular triple A stuff to more niche and lesser known games.',
'They also had a section of the store dedicated to board games as well.',
'Lisa: Oh, there it is.',
'Lisa picks up a game from one of the many shelves and looks at the cover.',
'I glance over her shoulder to see what she grabbed.',
'User: Oh, Animal Xing.',
'Lisa: Yes. A lot of the girls in the office were talking about this game. I happened to overhear their conversation about it \
and I got a little interested in the game.',
'It doesn\'t look like my type of game but I can definately see the appeal.',
'The two of us continue to look around for a little longer before we decided we\'d looked enough.',
'In the end, the both of us pick up a few games to purchase.',
'Honestly I can see the appeal in retail therapy. It feels good buying stuff, even if it\'s just games.',
'Now last on the list is that bath.',
'I looked up some stuff online yesterday and decided to pick up some stuff for my bath before I went home.',
'At home, I prep the bath and hop in.',
