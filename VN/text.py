    'It\'s been about 2 years since I graduated college.',
    'Luckily for me, I got a job offer almost as soon as I graduated so I didn\'t have\
 to go though all the trouble of finding work. If I had to complain about something \
it would definately have to be my perpetual boredom.',
'I\'ve got no hobbies, no real interests, and nothing to do but work everyday. I wanted a change of pace so I bought myself a \
pet turtle (his name is Jimmy). Him and my roommate have done a lot to help me but even so I just can\'t seem to shake this feeling.',
    'User*Sigh* Mornin\' Jimmy. I guess it\'s gonna be another uneventful day huh, bud?',
    'Jimmy.....*blub*',
    'UserYeah, that\'s what I thought. Welp, let\'s get this show on the road!',
    '...........',
    'My office is located in the heart of Toronto. I don\'t make enough money to live close to the office so my friend, Aiya, and \
I rented a place closer to the outskirts together, mainly because she also works nearby. Since I go to work earlier than she does, I\'m usually the one making \
breakfast. Thanks to that I\'ve gotten pretty good if I do say so myself.',
'I was a bit more tired than usual this morning and I got lazy so for today\'s breakfast, scrambled eggs over toast should do it.',
'UserMmm- pretty good. Sometimes a simple breakfast really is the best.',
'Having finished breakfast, I tidied up, left some food out for Aiya, and got ready for work.',
'The area I lived in wasn\'t anything special. It\'s a nice distance away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Toronto. \
Frankly, I\'m pretty glad I live somewhere like this. Being in the city can be quite the exhausting experience.',
'The air here is soothing and the scenery makes me feel relaxed. The bus stop is only a ten minute walk from where I live \
so I try and make the most of the walk.',
f'WomanHeya {name}! Good morning!',
'The woman calling out to me in such an energetic fashion is Rebecca. She goes to the university here and we happen to ride the same bus. \
You wouldn\'t expect her to have a good head on her shoulders just by looking at her. She\'s unexpentedly smart and plenty cute as well.',
'Her short, blonde hair went well with her playful personality. She wasn\'t very tall, maybe about 5\'4\"? \
Her smaller frame and petite facial features are decieving to say the least. Only her large, round eyes juxtaposed the rest of her appearance. Honestly, you \
could probably mistake her for a middle schooler if not for her massive bo-*cough*. Okay, maybe I\'m stretching it but she \
really does look younger than she is.',
'UserYea, mornin\' Becca.',
'We first met a little after I started working. I had always been the only person at this stop so the sudden appearance \
was a shock, but a welcome one.',
'RebeccaNo bagel today?',
'To explain, the first time we met she apparently had skipped breakfast as I could hear her stomach relentlessly growling. \
I was a little late that day so I brought a bagel with me to eat on the commute. I felt kinda bad so I offered her half of my bagel \
and it\'s been our thing ever since. Today however, I was out of bagels.',
'UserSorry we just ran out. I\'ll make sure to get some on my way home today.',
'RebeccaYou better. I don\'t know how I\'ll survive without them. The ones you bring always taste better for some reason.',
'UserI get them at a bakery not many people know about. Maybe I\'ll take you there someday. They\'re a lot better when they\'re fresh.',
'Of course that probably wasn\'t going to happen. It\'s not like we talk to each other beyond this morning commute.',
'RebeccaYeah... I\'d like that.',
'The rest of the ride was the same as any other day. We talked about what we did the other day, our favourite TV shows, good restaurants \
in the area, anything really. Everything was the same but something felt a little different, though I couldn\'t tell what it was.',
'User(Maybe it\'s the lack of bagel)',
'The time flew by as we talked and soon enough we arrived at Rebecca\'s stop.',
'RebeccaWell, I\'m off. I\'m holding you to that offer m\'kay? Later, see\'ya tomorrow!',
'UserMhm, see\'ya tomorrow.',
'The rest of my ride was filled with the cacophony of the city and soon enough I arrived at work.',

'User(As serious as always huh..)',
'That just now was Lisa. When I first started working here she was assigned to train me. I was put into a team of about ten people or so \
with Lisa being our supervisor. Thanks to her and the rest of the team I was able to get up to speed and quickly be of use.',
'Lisa........ *click* *clack* ........\n.................. *ring* *ring*\n....Hello?...',
'After answering the phone, Lisa promptly gets up and walks away with a few folders in her hand. Perhaps she had a meeting today.',
'!Lisa is almost the complete opposite of Becca. She\'s maybe 5\'8\" even without heels. Her long, straight, black hair complemented \
her serious attitude. Long eyelashes draped over her long thin eyes. Everything about her, from her appearance to her personality \
was as sharp as a razor blade. To put it in one word, she was beautiful.',
'ManLooking at Lisa again, are ya?',
'This guy is Ben. He\'s a super outgoing \'bro\' type of person. He\'s got pretty short, brown hair and a pretty well defined \
face. Pretty attractive that guy, not that I\'d ever date him. If I ever saw him on the street I would never think he worked \
a white collar job.',
'UserGet off my back.',
'BenNo need to get so hostile, it was just a question. Anyway how about we get something to drink after work today? I just found this great place the other day.',
'UserSure, sure. I\'ve got nothing better to do. Just don\'t go too crazy like you did last time. I\'m never gonna live that shit down.',
'BenGod, don\'t remind me. Let\'s take this chance to do a re-do of that night. Lisa\'s coming back so I\'ll take my leave. \
Meet me in front of the entrance after work \'kay?',
'I give him a slight nod as he turns and makes his way back to his desk.',
'The hours pass by as I click and clack my way across the keyboard, tackling a few odd jobs Lisa assigned to me.',
'User(I wonder what I\'ll have for lunch today).',
'Even though I make breakfast in the morning, I don\'t have enough time to make a decent lunch nor do I really bother to make one \
the previous day. That being said, for lunch I frequent the convenience store because, well, it\'s convenient.',
'Before I leave, someone calls out to me.',
f'LisaHey, {name}, I\'m assuming you\'re headed to the convenience store, right? Would you mind grabbing something for me? \
I\'ve got something urgent I need to take care of.',
'UserThat\'s no problem. Do you have something specific in mind?',
'LisaNope, you can get me whatever. Here, to cover the expense.',
'She hands me a nice, crisp 10 dollar bill.',
'LisaYou can keep the change.',
'UserOhh, nice one. You were pretty cool there Lisa.',
'LisaJ-just hurry.',
'She was trying to hide it but I could tell she was blushing a little.',
'Despite her seemingly cold exterior, Lisa can be sensitive at times so I like to tease her a bit here and there. Though \
if I did it too much, she would probably have no trouble at all firing me.',
'UserAlright, I\'ll be on my way then.',
'Lisa*Ahem* Thank you. I\'ll just be at my desk when you get back.',
'With that, she briskly makes her way back to her desk and immediately sets off to work.',
'User(I guess I\'ll get going then).',
'............................',
'The city gets much more congested at this time which is one of the reasons I go to the convenience store. If I tried to go \
anywhere else, my lunch break would end before I got to eat anything.',
'User(Hm.. I wonder what I should get today).',
'The cold, air-conditioned interior of the convenience store hits my face as soon as the doors open.',
'User(Maybe I\'ll grab a sandwich. It\'d be easy for Lisa to eat while she works too).',
'As I\'m looking at the sandwich options displayed, a lady starts restocking and replacing products beside me.',
'User(I haven\'t seen her here before, maybe she\'s a new hire).',
'Once she leaves, I resume picking out a sandwich and some drinks before heading to the counter to pay.',
'She was pretty though. She had her brown hair tied up in a tidy ponytail. Looks to me like the sporty type. From the looks \
of it, she had a good amount of muscle but it wasn\'t obtrusive in any way.',
'Because of my frequenting this place I got to know the people working here pretty well, almost to the point I\'d call them friends. The staff \
has never changed since the first time I shopped here from what I know.',
'User(I hope I get the chance to talk to her).',
'I walk up to the counter and lo and behold, she was stationed behind the register waiting for me to come pay.',
'User(The world works in mysterious ways huh).',
'I guess this is as good of a chance as any to make aquaintences with her. I walk up to the register with the two drinks and \
sandwiches I picked out for lunch. (I got simple club sandwiches and bottled tea by the way).',
'Woman*beep* *beep* *beep* *beep*\nWIll that be all?',
'UserYup. Say, are you new here?',
'The nametag on her chest read \'Chris\'.',
'ChrisMhm, I just started late last week.',
'UserI thought so. I\'ll be coming here often so I hope we can get along.',
'ChrisI hope so too. So let\'s see.. your total comes out to $14.35.',
'I hand her the crisp ten dollar bill that Lisa gave me as well as some of my own change.',

'UserThanks miss.',
'ChrisJust call me Chris.',
f'UserThen call me {name}. Well I\'m off now.',
f'ChrisCome back soon {name}, alright?',
'UserSure thing.',

'I grab one of each of the sandwiches and bottles of tea I bought and hand them over to Lisa.',
'LisaThanks.',
'She puts her lunch on her desk then gets up and turns to face me.',
'LisaI\'ll get straight to the point. We\'re quite shorthanded on a current project I\'m leading. There\'s no one else on \
this team I can get to help me as they\'re all working on projects of their own.',
'LisaI\'m not forcing you to help. You would be of great assisstance but it\'d be a lot of work on your end that you might \
not be used to just yet. If you do accept, I\'ll help you as much as I can.',
'LisaI\'ll give you some time to think about it as long as you can come up with an answer by the end of the week. \
That gives you about three days, is that okay?',
'UserYes, that\'s enough time. I\'ll give it some thought at home today. Then, if that\'s all, I\'m off to eat lunch.',
'LisaOf course. Thank you again for buying this for me.',
'UserWas no problem at all.',

with work for the day. He brought some of his other buddies and I got to know them a bit while we drank.',
